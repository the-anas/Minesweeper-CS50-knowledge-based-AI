This project is a knowledge based artificial intelligence that plays the classical minesweeper game to 
the best of its ability using the knowledge of its past moves. Note that this AI is not optimal and
includes an element of randomness to make moves when it is not aware of any safe moves. However, since 
it uses knowledge, the further it progresses into the game the more likley it is to win. 

The logic for the AI is implemented in the minesweeper.py file while the graphical interface for the
game is provided in the runner.py file. (runner.py was provided by course owner)
To properly run this project, run the runner.py file.
This project is implemented as part of the CS50 Artificial Intelligence course, to know more about
